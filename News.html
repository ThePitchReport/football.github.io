            <p>"We started very well, very dynamic, brave and proactive," Manchester United coach Erik Ten Hag
                 said. "We created a lot of chances in that moment, and could have been two or three up.</p>
            <p>"We dominated the opponent in and out of possession. It was very enjoyable how the team played today.

                "It hasn't felt like a crisis for us. We've kept calm, worked on the process and we know where we have to build and what we have to build on.</p>
            <p>Scott McTominay's double took him to five Premier League goals for the season.</p>
            <p>"McTominay has the skills, when he is arriving in the right moment," he said. "He has the smell. Then he has a very good finish, but dynamics, sometimes he's deep and sometimes he is further forward.

                "In our tactics and our planning, it's often that we want him to be high, so the team has to make it happen that he can come into those positions where he's around a striker and then he has a very good smell of when to arrive and he's a good finisher too.
                
                "It's the plan, it's not hard - it's a matter of organisation. That's our job to get the players in the right position, but it means other players have to play deeper."</p>
            <p>Chelsea coach Mauricio Pochettino said that he wasn't disappointed because they gave everything, but didn't match the energy or aggressiveness. They created chances, maybe enough to draw the game." </p>
